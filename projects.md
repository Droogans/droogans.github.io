Here is a list of some of the things I've worked on in the past. Most are archived!

 - [Texas Euchre](https://github.com/PlaytestersKitchen/texas-euchre/blob/master/README.md): a short, easy card game for 3 - 5 players.
 - [My Emacs configuration files](https://github.com/Droogans/.emacs.d), if that's the kind of thing you're into.
 - [My dotfiles](https://github.com/Droogans/dotfiles), if you want to see things I like to use in my PS1 bash prompt.
 - [python-module-resources](https://github.com/captain-kark/python-module-resources) a python library for importing json data from a directory, like nodejs does.
 - A pull request which [adds support to python-web-pdb for multiple debugger instances in docker-compose environments](https://github.com/romanvm/python-web-pdb/pull/13).
 - [ngCalc]({{ site.baseurl }}ngCalc): a simple web-based calculator written in AngularJS.
 - Command line tools as docker images, including one for using [Shamir's secret sharing algorithm](https://github.com/captain-kark/dockerfile-secretsharing), and for verifying [secure communications with a static (hardcoded) gpg message recipient](https://github.com/captain-kark/dockerfile-veracode-gpg).
 - [encore-ui](https://rackerlabs.github.io/encore-ui/#/overview): a library of reusable AngularJS widgets.
