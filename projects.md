Here is a list of some of the things I've worked on in the past. Most are archived!

 - [My Emacs configuration files](https://github.com/Droogans/.emacs.d), if that's the kind of thing you're into.
 - [My dotfiles](https://github.com/Droogans/dotfiles), if you want to see things I like to use in my PS1 bash prompt.
 - [ngCalc]({{ site.baseurl }}ngCalc): a simple web-based calculator written in AngularJS.
 - [encore-ui](https://rackerlabs.github.io/encore-ui/#/overview): a library of reusable AngularJS widgets.
