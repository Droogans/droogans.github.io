Here is a list of some of the things I'm working on at the moment.

 - [ngCalc]({{ site.baseurl }}ngCalc): a simple web-based calculator written in AngularJS.
 - [encore-ui](http://rackerlabs.github.io/encore-ui/#/overview): a library of reusable AngularJS widgets.
 - [Texas Euchre](https://github.com/PlaytestersKitchen/texas-euchre/blob/master/README.md): a short, easy card game for 3 - 5 players.
 - [A Selenium-webdriver tutorial](https://github.com/Droogans/ProtractorPageObjects/), featuring the Protractor library.
 - [My Emacs configuration files](https://github.com/Droogans/.emacs.d), if that's the kind of thing you're into.
