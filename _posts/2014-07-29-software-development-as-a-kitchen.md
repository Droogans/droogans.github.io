title: Software Development as a Kitchen

One of my favorite things about software development is how many things are tangentially related to it. The [catb.org](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html#style) site lists a number of things that are mysteriously associated with the practice of software development, but leave out a pretty good analogy to the profession as a whole: the restaurant kitchen.

### Forward

I used to work as a fry cook, and later as a server when I worked many, many different jobs in my late teenage years. I later did some informal study with a culinary drop-out who loved cooking, and have since found myself drawn to the dedication and passion found in the field in general. I enjoy watching people cook more than I enjoy cooking myself. I prefer raw food, personally, out of the sheer utility of it.

My experience as a software developer has been a climb through companies ranging from four technology workers and 40 employees, to international companies that employ thousands of engineers who support billions in assets and sales. I have worked at small startups, mid-size, national and international software companies over the past five years.

At first it can be a bit of a stretch to associate a line cook to a programmer, but by broadening the scope of discussion to include how a restaurant succeeds and fails, you can begin to see some similarities for software companies. In short, the more emphasis a restaurant can put on the quality of its food, and the skill and creativity of its culinary leadership, the more likely they are to succeed. Likewise, the better a company is able to leverage the creativity and talents of their development staff, the more likely that company's product will be associated with high quality, leading to success. I'll run through some stereotypical instances of restaurants, their owners, and those that work in them, and relate them to software companies who operate in similar fashion. I think it's fun to compare and contrast restaurants to the types of software engineering jobs that exist in the industry, and feel like there's some important lessons to be learned by relating the two industries together.

### The Line Cook

You have no experience, you're not sure you even want to do this kind of thing for a living, but you need to pay your rent this month. Just about anyone could qualify to work as a line cook in a cheap restaurant, granted they can identify the most basic of things in a kitchen. It's not a bad thing, either; these are the type of places that can give interested folks exposure to what even bad restaurants need to do to operate, equipping them with a basic vocabulary and training, among other things. Unfortunately, only the most rudimentary of techniques are used. Anyone who has used this place as a stepping stone has already moved on, as they aren't socially tolerated for long. Which is probably the best thing for everyone involved. Most cooks with tenure have lost any semblance of hope of ever evolving in their trade, and don't take what they do very seriously. Having a young beginner in their midst who sees themselves as having potential someday is simply put, demoralizing. It's good to leave as soon as you're ready to, or else you may begin to believe what you hear from your co-workers who are trapped in the grind for the foreseeable future.

### Restaurant Cook

Raw efficiency is still the absolute goal here, but some flexibility is offered in the form of presentation, which matters some. As in, you can't ravage a plate, but anything short of receiving a complaint is acceptable. Like the line cook, a restaurant cook is treated to a zero tolerance policy in the form of dish creativity. To waver from the menu in even the most trivial ways is grounds for termination. You follow the script or you will be replaced by someone who will, and those types may very well likely be Line Cooks looking to move up in their careers. The pay is low, but better than the Line Cook's minimum wage jobs. Those who write the menu are far removed from the day to day grind experienced by the kitchen, and usually cannot be reached for questions or complaints. You are exposed to the menu in general, but trained to create just the parts that you're responsible for. At first, it's the simplest, most unbearable (or boring) parts of the menu -- salads and fried items. As you move to the flat, and later the grill, you are in charge of handling no less boring tasks, but ones that involve ingredients that call for more finesse than bags of frozen shrimp and pre-chopped vegetables. The continuum of the Restaurant Cook's employment options has a wide range, from just above terrible to quite impressive. But what never changes is the cookie cutter model, which dictates exactly how a dish should be executed, with strict consequences for those that fail to deliver on that vision. This is a requirement for this business model to function at the scale of hundreds or thousands of operating locations.

### Upscale Hotel or Hospital Chef

This is where the term "chef" is first used, as it isn't uncommon for a chef employed in these places to be told to "make something that will fit in with this person's requests", and be expected to create a dish that meets the criteria for the customer. In a hospital, this may be a dietary restriction. In a hotel, it may be certain tastes or the inclusion of different cuisine styles. All of these things imply that the chef is capable of understanding and functioning well within a loose set of boundaries, and producing high-quality dishes efficiently. A menu may exist, but as mainly as a fallback for those who are at a complete loss for what they can ask for. The menu may be a collection of basic items that are too simple to justify any

### Culinary School

Introduction to "proper" planning, management, and execution of a restaurant as a whole. These areas are broken up by career, but all are related to providing the best dining experience possible to the customer.

### Chef de partie

Separation of concerns and specialization is introduced. You may be able to do everything here, but you're not expected to. You focus on one specific area of the kitchen, and produce lots of high-quality dishes this way.

### Sous-chef

You can realistically affect what is being served by a high quality, modern restaurant.

### Chef de cuisine

Once you've become an executive at several locations, you run the risk of distancing yourself from the ebb and flow of the kitchen, instead dictating overall direction from a vantage point that may not provide all the information necessary to succeed.
