Software developer in test at Rackspace Hosting, San Antonio, Texas. That means I leverage heavy use of the [Selenium automation framework](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selenium_%28software%29#Selenium_WebDriver). Basically, I write software that pretends to be a user on a website to make sure nothing is broken.

Aside from writing software, I enjoy listening to and playing music, traveling on the cheap, and boardgames.

And writing, from time to time.
